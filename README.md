# Hollow Knight: Ultimatum Radiance
Mod for Hollow Knight to make Absolute Radiance, the hardest boss, even harder. Attacks are much more dense and hectic than before, and there's a couple new nasty surprises too.

Builds are included in the Releases tab, but it's recommended to get it from the [mod launcher](https://radiance.host/mods/ModInstaller.exe) instead for automatic installation and updates.

The code is based on [Lost Lord](https://github.com/5FiftySix6/HollowKnight.Lost-Lord) by 56.
